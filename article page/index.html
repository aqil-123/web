    <p> <b>Discord</b> is an instant messaging and VoIP social platform which allows communication through voice calls, video calls, text messaging, and media. Communication can be private or take place in virtual communities called "servers".[note 2] A server is a collection of persistent chat rooms and voice channels which can be accessed via invite links. Discord runs on Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, iPadOS, Linux, and in web browsers. As of 2024, the service has about 150 million monthly active users and 19 million weekly active servers.[8] It is primarily used by gamers, although the share of users interested in other topics is growing.[9] As of March 2024, Discord was the 30th most visited website in the world with 22.98% of its traffic coming from the United States.[10][11] In March 2022, Discord employed 600 people globally.[12]</p>
